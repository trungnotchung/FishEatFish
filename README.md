# Fish Eat Fish
My Advanced Programming project - a game built with SDL and C++.
## Macos Install

* First, install [g++](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/gcc#default) using Homebrew
* Second, download [SDL2](https://github.com/rosejoshua/QuickSDL2Mac), [SDL2_mixer](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_mixer/releases), [SDL2_image](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_image/releases/tag/release-2.6.3), [SDL2_ttf](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_ttf/releases/tag/release-2.20.2). Put all this stuff to a folder named ``SDL2.framework``.  Or else, just download [my installed library](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10YlzZuQPUc5oR2w4aWxxQ1EQC_B761Xt/view?usp=sharing). Set it to ``/Library/Frameworks``.
* Third, clone this repo. Change directory to ``src`` folder. Open ``cmd`` and type ``chmod u+x comprun.sh``, then type ``./comprun.sh``. The game screen will appear.
* Now enjoy the game..! ðŸ˜‹
